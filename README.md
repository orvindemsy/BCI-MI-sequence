# Basic Two Class BCI-MI User Interface
This user interface provides two class for MI-based brain computer interface (BCI) trainin and testing, was developed mainly using pygame

# About
This program serves as interface for classical BCI motor imagery application. Two major programs are used in this application, the first one is the GUI program which is built in python language. Second one is the program that interacts with g.tec USB AMP device to record EEG signal. This one is an exe application generated by program written in C#. In this document the first program (GUI) may be referred as ‘master’, while the second one (recording) is referred as ‘slave’.

# Hardware and Software Requirements
These specification/ tools are required to conduct the experiment:
- Windows 10 OS (g.tec USB AMP only compatible to this OS)
- PyCharm (or equivalent python IDE)
- Program dependencies (explain in the next chapter)
- g.tec USB AMP device and its power supply & USB cable
- g.tec USB AMP driver & g.tec C API driver installer

# How It Works
